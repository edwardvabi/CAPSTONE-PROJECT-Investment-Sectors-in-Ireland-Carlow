# CAPSTONE-PROJECT-Investment-Sectors-in-Ireland-Carlow
## Introduction 
Ireland may have 40 shades of green, but Carlow can cater for 40 shades of green fingers. The Carlow Garden Trail is one of the island’s best, while the wild, natural-style gardens at Altamont House are home to an explosion of snowdrops every February. Dive into the heart of Ireland’s Ancient East and wander the ancient yew tree walk at Huntington Castle, where the ghosts of monks have been known to mosey. Then there are the Delta Sensory Gardens on the outskirts of Carlow town, a therapeutic and multi-sensory oasis for visitors of all abilities. The county, over the years, has been a huge attraction to tourists. The influx of people into the county also brings in money into local businesses like restaurants, cinemas, pubs, fast foods etc. You can make outings to noble estates on the outskirts of Carlow, like Duckett’s Grove, which has the dreamlike ruins of a Gothic Revival house that burnt down in 1933. Although not geared for tourism, Carlow has real charm, especially on the banks of the River Barrow and the old center at Montgomery and Burin Streets, which have rows of Georgian houses. However, these varying businesses are found in different neighborhoods. Some neighborhoods have more of a business than others. The distribution of different businesses in the respective neighborhoods could be of great interest to investors who are new to the city. The problem that this project aims to solve is to facilitate the investors’ choice of neighborhood to invest in and the type of business that could do well in that neighborhood.  

Data Description To solve the mentioned problem, geolocation data on all the businesses was obtained. Foursquare was the location data provider of choice from which the data for this analysis was retrieved. The data used was obtained from Irish townlands data with 326 baronies, 2,507 civil parishes, 3,474 electoral divisions, 61,108 townlands currently mapped on OpenStreetMap.
